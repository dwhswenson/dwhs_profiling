# dwhs_profiling

Some wrappers and tools for profiling Python.

Primarily intended for users of IPython/Jupyter notebooks, to do interactive analysis of profiling results.

Everything here rests on the shoulders of CProfile and line_profile. Don't expect any extra functionality, this just makes it easier for me to reach certain capabilities of those projects.
