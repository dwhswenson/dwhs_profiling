# dwhs_profiling

Some wrappers and tools for profiling Python.

Primarily intended for users of IPython/Jupyter notebooks, to do interactive
analysis of profiling results.

Everything here rests on the shoulders of `CProfile` and `line_profiler`.
Don't expect any extra functionality, this just makes it easier for me to
reach certain capabilities of those projects.
